<p>CSA Writing Team (CWT) was started with an intention to bridge the gap between researchers, professors, scientists and prospective students who may not be familiar with the domain of research. The audience is not just limited to fresh students but also to students currently pursuing research within CSA as well as other institutions. Themes surrounding computer science research, problems, solutions and the like are encouraged.</p>
